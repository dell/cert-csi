# Running All Test Suites

This directory contains the driver-specific certify config YAMLs that cert-csi can use to execute tests against multiple storage classes to check if the driver adheres to advertised capabilities. 

For more information on the capabilities defined in the config YAMLs, please refer to the [cert-csi documentation](https://dell.github.io/csm-docs/docs/support/cert-csi/#run-all-test-suites).
